        "#### 1. Exact Match (EM)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Exact Match metric checks if the predicted answer exactly matches the ground truth answer (the correct answer from the dataset).\n",

        "###### Step-by-step Calculation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The prediction is compared to the ground truth after normalizing both. Normalization includes lowercasing, removing articles (a, an, the), punctuation, and extra whitespace.\n",
        "2. If the normalized predicted answer is exactly the same as the normalized ground truth answer, the score for that prediction is 1.\n",

However, this outcome was anticipated due to the limited training data and computational resources used.\n",

        "- **Training Data**: The model was trained on less than 10% of the SQuAD dataset, which significantly restricts the amount of information the model can learn from. Given the complexity of the dataset, which requires a deep understanding of context to answer questions accurately, the reduced dataset likely resulted in the model not fully capturing all nuances necessary for higher accuracy.\n",

        "- **Training Setup**: The training was conducted on Google Colab using a **Tesla T4 GPU**, and to manage the available computational power, the model was fine-tuned for only **3 epochs**. These restrictions meant that the model had limited opportunities to optimize and learn the patterns in the data.

        "    - The model and tokenizer were loaded from a locally saved directory (`distillbert_squad`) using the `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering` and `DistilBertTokenizerFast` classes from the HuggingFace `transformers` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Pipeline Setup**: \n",

        "\n",
        "3. **API Endpoint**:\n",
        "    - A `/predict` endpoint was defined using the Flask `@app.route` decorator, which listens for **POST** requests. \n",
        "    - The request body must include two fields: a \"questiomn\" and a \"context\". \n",
        "    - The input is validated, and if either field is missing, an error response with a 400 status code is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inference**:\n",
        "    - The model generates a prediction (answer) and confidence score using the `qa_pipeline`. This output is then returned to the client as a JSON object, which includes the original question, the context, the predicted answer, and the modelâs confidence score.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Deployment**:\n",
        "    - The Flask app is set to run on `0.0.0.0` to allow external access, using port 5000. For local testing with ngrok, `run_with_ngrok` can be uncommented.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Setup**: \n",
        "   - In the `setUp()` method, I initialized the Flask app's test client using `app.test_client()`. This allows us to simulate HTTP requests to the API without running the server.\n",
        "   - Testing mode is enabled by setting `self.app.testing = True`, which helps catch any errors during test execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Test Cases**:\n",
        "   - **`test_predict_success()`**: \n",
        "     - This test checks if the `/predict` endpoint works as expected when valid input (both question and context) is provided.\n",
        "     - A POST request is sent with a sample question and context related to \"quantization\".\n",
        "     - The test verifies:\n",
        "       - The response format is JSON.\n",
        "       - The status code is `200 OK`.\n",
        "       - The response contains an `answer` key, and the confidence `score` is greater than a reasonable threshold (0.2).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **`test_predict_missing_data()`**:\n",
        "     - This test checks the API's behavior when the input is incomplete (missing context).\n",
        "     - A POST request is sent with only a question, but no context.\n",
        "     - The test verifies:\n",
        "       - The API returns a `400 Bad Request` status due to missing data.\n",
        "       - The response contains an `error` key indicating the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Running the Tests**:\n",
        "   - The tests are executed using `unittest.main()` when the script is run directly. This will automatically discover and run all test cases in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "These tests ensure the core functionality of the API and handle common input validation scenarios.\n"
